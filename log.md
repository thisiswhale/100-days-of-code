# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot how to form array helpers, a good skill to know how some JavaScript conventions were created in the first place. Good intermediate level practice for my brain.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars

**Thoughts:** I managed to solve the first two problems. I compared the answers from other submissions so I can learn other methods and their thought process. However, I had a tough time with the last one. It involves with searching within an Object. It was a tough and the hint were confusing me more. I had to look at the solution. It took me a while to finally understand the code. I need to review some more about searching Objects.
