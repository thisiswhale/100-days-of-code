# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot how to form array helpers, a good skill to know how some JavaScript conventions were created in the first place. Good intermediate level practice for my brain.

### Day 1: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I managed to solve the first two problems. I compared the answers from other submissions so I can learn other methods and their thought process. However, I had a tough time with the last one. It involves with searching within an Object. It was a tough and the hint were confusing me more. I had to look at the solution. It took me a while to finally understand the code. I need to review some more about searching Objects.

### Day 14: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**:I styled the weather app.

**Thoughts:** I had a busy Sunday and I started styling at late evening. I got irritated at some fundamentals I learn to center my divs doesn't seem to work. But I got my divs to go where I wanted. I think CSS is my biggest weakness since its a blank canvas to start. I getting the hang of it. Its hard to keep coding after an exhausted day.

### Day 15: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**:I finished the weather app, started the next project, Wikipedia viewer, and did some problems on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I didn't think my weather app took longer than I thought. I like how it turned out. I decided to do some advanced problems on FreeCodeCamp to get the Front-end certificate. Wikipedia's API documentation is difficult to understand.

2. [Symmetric Difference](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/symmetric-difference)

### Day 17: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I was able to get JSON results from wiki to render to the page. Solved a problem from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I found a issue where Wiki's endpoints is an object and I could not push the whole object to an array. I try to figure out different ways how to render to the DOM when its JSON returns an object or an array and how to convert an object to an array. I felt I was progressing slow because of this issue. As for the algorithms, I had to look up the answer. I feel I know how to code it, but I wanted to code a cleaner way. The next problem is not tough but it involves alot of typing code. I haven't finished that yet.

### Day 18: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved bugs on rendering issues from JSON to html DOM and refactoring.

**Thoughts:** I was out the entire day and I tried to do as much with little free time within the day. I forgot that the fetch command is an asynchronous method that gave me return issues for my project to work.

### Day 21: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Used two fetch commands to place data into one array. Attempt to render into html dom.

**Thoughts:** Because of fetch async conditions, the programming is giving out of order results. I've been trying to figure out how to do something after an important step is complete.

1. [Who's on Twitch](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Whos-on-Twitch)

### Day 22: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Display the data to HTML.

### Day 38: February 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Simon game

**Thoughts:** I had an idea to make a Simon game based off of Steven Universe's Four Diamonds. I downloaded Audacity to make the edits of the sound, but I'll have to scrap that idea, since they all sound similar. Took me hours, to find the sounds and learn the software...

1. [Simon Game](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Simon)

### Day 39: February 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Simon game

**Thoughts:** I decided to start designing the layout since I already got sound when I pressed the panels. I just thought it be better to look at it while designing my code.

1. [Simon Game](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Simon)

1. [Simon Game](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Simon)

### Day 44: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started to create a Markdown Previewer using React.

**Thoughts:** I've been testing and playing around how React be rendered into the DOM without Webpack. I was taught to use Webpack for React but not thinking if its possible without it. I need Node.js to get Webpack to build. I'm taking a very slow pace to get started because I need to think about what are my development tools for this one. So after many considerations, I decided to add Node and Webpack for this project.

1. [Markdown-Previewer](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Markdown-Previewer)

### Day 45: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Understanding React to build Markdown Previewer.

**Thoughts:** I feel pretty flustered and overwhelmed using React. I forgot how complex React was. I'm reading its documentation and doing the FreeCodeCamp's React lessons while applying what I learn into this project so far I'm getting an error and I don't know why I'm getting that no matter how I alter it. I feel my workflow is over complicating things as I shouldn't have so many separate components.

1. [Markdown-Previewer](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Markdown-Previewer)

### Day 46: February 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Understanding React and getting my workflow to build Markdown Previewer.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to get a hang of React again. I did more React exercises to get flow hanging. Things are started to make sense and now I'm over that wall. All the pieces are putting into place. Its just jumping hurdles from here on then. My SASS preprocessor works. I can have webpack and node-sass watch over my code every time I save. I decided to add Bootstrap and wow, the documentation makes sense to me now that I know more CSS and SASS material. Feeling excited.

1. [Markdown-Previewer](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Markdown-Previewer)

### Day 47: February 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working Markdown Previewer.

**Thoughts:** I'm really close to finishing this app. I really forgot how React conventions work, and I'm glad things are coming back quickly. I relearned how to update changes, and the importance of binding. I'm starting to get the hang of passing state into props so other Classes can use it.

1. [Markdown-Previewer](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Markdown-Previewer)

### Day 48: February 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Markdown Previewer. Started next project.

**Thoughts:** I really learned a lot using React in this project. I had fun making this project. I'm glad I'm seeing different viewpoints of React.

2. [Forum Leaderboard](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Forum-Leaderboard)

### Day 49: February 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixing a bug for Leaderboard.

**Thoughts:** I think I spent an hour why I'm getting a blank page when it turns out I was missing an '=' for my src attribute in my script tag in the HTML DOM. Embarrasing. Well I'm glad its working now. I sort of know how to get this going.

1. [Forum Leaderboard](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Forum-Leaderboard)

### Day 50: February 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on Leaderboard.

**Thoughts:** I managed to get my simple APIs to render to the DOM with React, now I tried to refractor my code but I'm having issues to render different ways.

1. [Forum Leaderboard](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Forum-Leaderboard)

### Day 51: February 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Leaderboard.

**Thoughts:** This project took longer than I thought. I had a huge error I'm not sure how to solve. I had to do some React exercises on FreeCodeCamp if something struck a lightbulb. I asked online for help and they did. I'm happy with how it looks.

1. [Forum Leaderboard](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Forum-Leaderboard)

### Day 52: February 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Building a workflow with Webpack. Starting next project

**Thoughts:** I spent all day reading up on Webpack documentations to build the ultimate Webpack complier for my React and SASS projects. I learned so much about Webpack than I did before. Turns out, Webpack 4 is a hot new library to use. I'm glad I got a taste how to make my own Webpack config. I just want to make my next project build with a proper workflow where Webpack can compile both SASS and React.

### Day 53: March 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sampling to use Semantics or Bootstrap with React

**Thoughts:** I'm not so sure how to make cool css features in React since animated styles requires JS. I'm having confusion converting JS into React conventions. I decided to check Semantics and Bootstrap since they have its own CSS library that works with React. This will be good practice to use more libraries with React.

1. [Recipe Box](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Recipe-Box)

### Day 54: March 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** I'm learning how Bootstrap works with React. So far its straight forward.

1. [Recipe Box](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Recipe-Box)

### Day 55: March 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on Recipe Box

**Thoughts:** Able to add a recipe. So many detail steps to add a tab.

1. [Recipe Box](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Recipe-Box)

### Day 56: March 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Recipe app can update and delete a recipe card in own's localStorage.

**Thoughts:** I made a lot of progress and I'm almost done.  I just need to refractor and style it.

1. [Recipe Box](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Recipe-Box)

### Day 57: March 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Refractor code by splitting into Components and pass as props.

**Thoughts:** There was a day I forget to push my log, so a recent commit I push had two log posts. Anyways.. I'm happy of my result. I learned alot about passing props and I feel I shouldn't attempt on doing everything on a Component and then split it to make it more readable. Though, its a learning process to get used to React conventions, it feels redundant.

1. [Recipe Box](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Recipe-Box)

### Day 58: March 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Game of Life: rendering dynamic grid size

**Thoughts:** This project sounds challenging yet exciting. This involves a lot of math theory and I find it interesting.

1. [Game Of Life](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Game-of-life)

### Day 59: March 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Enable grid selection for Game of Life

**Thoughts:** I was worried that the math part would be a challenge, but I realize that styling the whole layout is also a challenge. Like changing the background color of a button. For example, one of the three buttons can only be lit. If I press a different button, the others change back its background color.

1. [Game Of Life](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Game-of-life)

### Day 60: March 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fix layout of the website

**Thoughts:** I skipped a day because I went to a career tech job fair yesterday that literally drained me to do anything. I've been preparing my resume for the job fair. I decided to start positioning my site before tackling the math stuff.

1. [Game Of Life](https://github.com/thisiswhale/Game-of-life)

### Day 61: March 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning Redux and more layout styling.

**Thoughts:** I've been thinking that I might need Redux for this project, so I did some Redux exercises to start thinking how to manage the state. Right now, I'm lost with the logic how a cell checks its neighbors. I decided to make my layout look prettier for now.

### Day 64: March 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned Game of Life code, update readme. Did some code problems on CodeFlights. Started Roguelike Dungeon Crawler game.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time organizing my code and I'm happy the way how my UI turned out. I found another site where it helps you improve your code solving problems while help you look for a job. I tried it out, but I brain felt drained. So I got stuck by some of their code problems when they are asking me to complete in ten minutes. I created a new Repo for my last React project. This one looks very challenging.

**Today's Progress**: Added a linter on Dungeon Crawler

**Thoughts:** I decided to add a linter on the project to try out the AirBnb code standards.

### Day 66: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixing webpack tools with eslint.

**Thoughts:** ESlint is very touchy with my code. Reasons my code won't run is because I'm not following right practices writing my code. I had webpack errors due to eslint so I spent most of today resolving this issue.

### Day 67: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning Redux and adding CharacterInfo Component.

**Thoughts:** ESlint is troubling me, its always showing red underlines and shows status that I shouldn't be doing. For example using i++ in a for loop. I think I'm going to remove it from my project because its wasting my time trying to make my code look standard and questionable about what is standard. I don't think I'm handling it correctly. I should work with eslint on something basic to get used to the convention.

### Day 68: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning to create a Map Generator

**Thoughts:** There's alot of steps I'm stuck to code like generating a random map, and having a character to randomize. I figure I need a generator map first before i can place characters and items.

### Day 69: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Build a Map Generator.

**Thoughts:** I found a tutorial creating a map generator and theres a lot of stuff going on. I need to read over and over to grasp the logic.

### Day 70: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Brainstorm for potential projects.

**Thoughts:** I spent a good chunk of time brainstorming for my next project I want to code for a month. I want to take a break away from my game.

### Day 71: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Build random room generator for the map.

**Thoughts:** This tutorial I followed has a nice explanation how map generators work, but its a lot of code so that took me a long time to understand what tis doing.

### Day 72: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implement event listener for key press and add Cartesian coordinates to locate player.

**Thoughts:** I was struggling why React wouldn't listen when I press key buttons on a div. It only works works for input. So it took me a while to decide to use DOM listeners. I'm gonna need the player's coordinates so I added it into the tables attributes.

### Day 73: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Testing Canvas

**Thoughts:** I'm starting a new project using Canvas. I've been researching what Canvas is about and testing its features. I'm planning to build a Pixel Art Editor. Also, I want to still work on my Roguelike Dungeon Game. So wish me luck, building two different projects simultaneously.

### Day 74: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Testing Canvas

**Thoughts:** I decided to take a break the other day. As much I wanted to work on it, I wasn't in the right mood. I was able to create a table grid. Most important feature is to able to fill in the cell with color. I'm still figuring that out.

### Day 75: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Pixel Art Pixel Editor

**Thoughts:** Feels like I've looked enough of Canvas to start the project. I have most of the code saved up on my Sandbox repo. There's a new gitflow method I'm trying out.

### Day 76: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Add button elements to Pixel Art Pixel Editor

**Thoughts:** I only had time today to put button elements with the icons I found online. I'm using Font Awesome. However, it does not have some icons I need for the editor like a paint bucket or color palette. I probably have to save svg files from different source instead.

### Day 77: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: C# review and preparing tomorrow's interview

**Thoughts:** The interview is tomorrow and I feel nervous, like most us feel for an interview. I feel pretty good about know most of C# fundamentals. I got to know more how their classes and methods work. Though I wished I put hours to work my projects. Its almost the end of my 100 day challenge. It feels like I've never did the challenge and just think about to keep learning. Let's make these days count!!

### Day 78: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Revising my portfolio

**Thoughts:** I feel I did pretty good on my interview, he asked me a pretty simple whiteboard question which took me less than 2 minutes to debunk it. It feels like a good conversation, but I honestly think I'm not the person he'd want me to hire. He wants someone who's familiar with C#. But I think I'll be fine. Feels like a mood booster to think it didn't go horribly bad. Now I want to revise my portfolio.

### Day 79: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Revising my portfolio

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to use Semantics UI, but there are so many bugs within React and the CSS version that I had to switch to Bootstrap. It was not worth my time to invest in it as it doesn't put out how I wanted. I had to restart my portfolio.

### Day 80: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Revising my portfolio

**Thoughts:** I'm comparing my code with someone else's portfolio. I really like this person's style. At the same time, I'm looking at updated bootstrap concepts that were outdated and comparing them with his portfolio. Wow, 19 more days. I need to speed things up.
