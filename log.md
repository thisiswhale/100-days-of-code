# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot how to form array helpers, a good skill to know how some JavaScript conventions were created in the first place. Good intermediate level practice for my brain.

### Day 1: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I managed to solve the first two problems. I compared the answers from other submissions so I can learn other methods and their thought process. However, I had a tough time with the last one. It involves with searching within an Object. It was a tough and the hint were confusing me more. I had to look at the solution. It took me a while to finally understand the code. I need to review some more about searching Objects.

**Thoughts:** I feel very productive and learned a lot about styling my websites. Even though its a refresher, its a good idea I come back to learn when my brain wasn't crammed with info overload when I did my coding bootcamp. Problems from Codewars were good morning and afternoon exercises to get my brain working.

### Day 12: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**:I did some problems on CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have spare time to work my website projects. I spend a few hours working on CodeWars problems. Took me while to solve it. A lightbulb struck and realized I made a bad assumption. Because of that, I wasted a lot of time on solving the wrong way.

### Day 13: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**:I did a problem on CodeWars and built the JavaScript files for the weather app.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't in the mood to code today, but I pushed myself by solving just one problem on CodeWars and eventually I wanted to work on the weather app. I got the JavaScript to work. Now, I need to make it look nice.

### Day 14: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**:I styled the weather app.

**Thoughts:** I had a busy Sunday and I started styling at late evening. I got irritated at some fundamentals I learn to center my divs doesn't seem to work. But I got my divs to go where I wanted. I think CSS is my biggest weakness since its a blank canvas to start. I getting the hang of it. Its hard to keep coding after an exhausted day.

### Day 15: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**:I finished the weather app, started the next project, Wikipedia viewer, and did some problems on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I didn't think my weather app took longer than I thought. I like how it turned out. I decided to do some advanced problems on FreeCodeCamp to get the Front-end certificate. Wikipedia's API documentation is difficult to understand.

### Day 16: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**:I learned how Wikipedia's API works and implemented into my project. Solved a problem from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After many gatherings, Wikipedia's API is not an east documentation to read. Thanks to google, I was able to get the right JSON file I wanted from Mr.Wiki. Also, I'm having a challenge to program Symmetric Difference. I'm still figuring out the logic.

### Day 17: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I was able to get JSON results from wiki to render to the page. Solved a problem from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I found a issue where Wiki's endpoints is an object and I could not push the whole object to an array. I try to figure out different ways how to render to the DOM when its JSON returns an object or an array and how to convert an object to an array. I felt I was progressing slow because of this issue. As for the algorithms, I had to look up the answer. I feel I know how to code it, but I wanted to code a cleaner way. The next problem is not tough but it involves alot of typing code. I haven't finished that yet.

### Day 18: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved bugs on rendering issues from json to html DOM and refractoring.

**Thoughts:** I was out the entire day and I tried to do as much with little free time within the day. I forgot that the fetch command is an asynchronous method that gave me return issues for my project to work.

### Day 19: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed WikiWhat Now projects. Did the styling and little fun animation.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy the way it turned out. Animating the moving search bar took a while to understand I finally got it to work. I have one more last intermediate project.

### Day 20: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Twitch API project.

**Thoughts:** Twitch's API documentation wasn't as bad as Wikipedia's. I managed to get the data and started planning the layout for the site.

### Day 21: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Used two fetch commands to place data into one array. Attempt to render into html dom.

**Thoughts:** Because of fetch async conditions, the programming is giving out of order results. I've been trying to figure out how to do something after an important step is complete.

### Day 22: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Display the data to HTML.

**Thoughts:** Took a while to figure it out, but I managed to get the data to display to the html. I learned createElement is a node that can be used once and is not a copy.
