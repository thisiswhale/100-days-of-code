# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot how to form array helpers, a good skill to know how some JavaScript conventions were created in the first place. Good intermediate level practice for my brain.
