# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot how to form array helpers, a good skill to know how some JavaScript conventions were created in the first place. Good intermediate level practice for my brain.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I managed to solve the first two problems. I compared the answers from other submissions so I can learn other methods and their thought process. However, I had a tough time with the last one. It involves with searching within an Object. It was a tough and the hint were confusing me more. I had to look at the solution. It took me a while to finally understand the code. I need to review some more about searching Objects.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and CodeWars.

**Thoughts:** I spent a good amount solving problems on FreeCodeCamp. It feels great to get a lot of problems done. I found another difficult Codewars problem that I had to look at the answers involving an Factorizations. I read its a common competitive programming question.

### Day 7: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Its taking me more than an hour to solve the challenges. I have one more challenge to complete the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting. I'm still working on Arguments Optional. I'm trying to implement a Closure in my program.

### Day 8: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through exercises from FreeCodeCamp and completed the functionality part of Stuff BoJack Horseman Says .

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to understand how Closures work. I had to look at the hints and answers since I had trouble organizing what the problem is asking. It's been a while I worked with getting JavaScript to connect to the Html DOM. I'm rough around the edges for now.

### Day 9: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**:I did some problems on CodeWars and started out how to layout my CSS for Stuff Bojack Says.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting the hang of organizing my CSS code. I used to feel overwhelmed but I'm glad I'm reviewing it and see things I overlooked. I really want to move up my rank to 5 kyu. Currently at 6 kyu.
